BepiColombo MK files
===========================================================================

     This ``aareadme.txt'' file describes the contents of the kernels/mk
     directory of the BepiColombo SPICE Kernel Dataset.

     It was last modified on November 26, 2019 by Marc Costa Sitja, ESAC/ESA.


Brief Summary
--------------------------------------------------------

     This directory contains the SPICE Meta-Kernel files for the BepiColombo
     mission. Meta-kernels (also known as ``FURNSH kernel'') are used
     to name a collection of kernels that are to be loaded into a user's
     application at run-time. Meta-kernels are appropriate to group kernels
     that correspond to a certain study group, phase or kernel state of the
     mission.


File naming conventions
--------------------------------------------------------

   Naming Scheme for BepiColombo mission MKs:

     The naming scheme for the BepiColombo spacecraft MKs is:

           bc[_DESC][_vXXX][_TAG][_NNN].tm

     where

           DESC      a brief description of the scope of study of the
                     scenario (optional);

           vXXX      version number that corresponds to the version of the
                     meta-kernel or the SPICE Kernel Dataset release number
                     (optional; e.g. v121 for Release 1.2.1)

           TAG       a time tag of the MK generation time (optional;
                     e.g. 20160928);

           NNN       a count of the MK version generated for a given TAG
                     (mandatory if TAG is included; e.g 001)

                          stored for archive purposes.


Particulars
--------------------------------------------------------

     Meta-Kernel file management is a critical element of any SPICE dataset.
     For ESA Planetary Missions the Meta-Kernels of the operational SPICE
     repositories are also used to control the version of the SPICE dataset.

     In general missions in operations will have an ``operational'' meta-kernel
     (OPS) and a ``planning'' meta-kernel (PLAN). In general, for BepiColombo
     the OPS MK includes as-flown information and short-term attitude and
     trajectory files from Flight Dynamics whereas the PLAN MK includes
     predicted and test trajectory and orientation. More in detail:

         The OPS meta-kernel will contain:
           - Trajectory: Predicted and reconstructed from Flight Dynamics
             (FDy); the data is in the same file, typically includes
             reconstruction and a predicted segment)
           - Attitude: As-flown orientation data from the Housekeeping
             (HK_TM) Telemetry and predicted/commanded attitude from FDy.
             The FDy prediction will be overwritten by the HK_TM
           - Structures/Payload: As-flown orientation without a default
             default profile (there might be data gaps)

         The PLAN meta-kernel will contain:
           - Trajectory: Predicted and reconstructed from FDy plus the MOI
             and Science Phase trajectories from Mission Analysis and a
             test extended mission trajectory.
           - Attitude: Predicted/commanded attitude from FDy and test
             attitude for the Cruise phase, MOI and science phase
             generated by the ESA SPICE Service.
           - Structures/Payload: Default profile (usage is not recommended).


     Since the periodicity of this updates ranges from hours to weeks, the MK
     in the Meta-Kernel directory does not have a version number and is
     regularly overwritten. Nevertheless in order to keep traceability and
     backwards compatibility with former MKs, a duplicate of every generated
     operational MK is stored. This duplicated MK filename is appended with a
     time tag and a version; if the original MK looks like:

        ftp/data/SPICE/BEPICOLOMBO/kernels/mk/bc_ops.tm

     the following duplicate is generated:

        ftp/data/SPICE/BEPICOLOMBO/kernels/mk/bc_ops_v230_20191128_001.tm

    bc_ops.tm                       Contains the latest available operational
                                    kernels generated by the SPICE operational
                                    pipeline.

    bc_ops_vXXX_YYYYMMDD_NNN.tm     Is a duplicate of the operational MK that
                                    derived from release vXXX. If multiple
                                    operational MK files are generated on the
                                    same date the version NNN is increased
                                    starting from 001. Read the ``Particulars''
                                    section for more information.

    bc_plan.tm                      Contains the long, mid and short term
                                    operational kernels generated by the SPICE
                                    operational pipeline.

    bc_plan_vXXX_YYYYMMDD_NNN.tm    Is a duplicate of the planning MK that
                                    derived from release vXXX. If multiple
                                    operational MK files are generated on the
